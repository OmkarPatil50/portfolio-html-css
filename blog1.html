      Dummy text: Its function as a filler or as a tool for comparing the
      visual impression of different typefaces Dummy text is text that is used
      in the publishing industry or by web designers to occupy the space which
      will later be filled with 'real' content. This is required when, for
      example, the final text is not yet available. Dummy text is also known
      as 'fill text'. It is said that song composers of the past used dummy
      texts as lyrics when writing melodies in order to have a 'ready-made'
      text to sing with the melody. Dummy texts have been in use by
      typesetters since the 16th century.

        <h2>The usefulness of nonsensical content</h2>
        <p>
          Dummy text is also used to demonstrate the appearance of different
          typefaces and layouts, and in general the content of dummy text is
          nonsensical. Due to its widespread use as filler text for layouts,
          non-readability is of great importance: human perception is tuned to
          recognize certain patterns and repetitions in texts. If the distribution
          of letters and 'words' is random, the reader will not be distracted from
          making a neutral judgement on the visual impact and readability of the
          typefaces (typography), or the distribution of text on the page (layout
          or type area). For this reason, dummy text usually consists of a more or
          less random series of words or syllables. This prevents repetitive
          patterns from impairing the overall visual impression and facilitates
          the comparison of different typefaces. Furthermore, it is advantageous
          when the dummy text is relatively realistic so that the layout
          impression of the final publication is not compromised.

        <h2>Incomprehensibility or readability? <span class="size-large">That is the question.</span></h2>
        <p>
          The most well-known dummy text is the 'Lorem Ipsum', which is said to have originated in the 16th century. Lorem Ipsum is composed in a pseudo-Latin language which more or less corresponds to 'proper' Latin. It contains a series of real Latin words. This ancient dummy text is also incomprehensible, but it imitates the rhythm of most European languages in Latin script. The advantage of its Latin origin and the relative meaninglessness of Lorum Ipsum is that the text does not attract attention to itself or distract the viewer's attention from the layout.
